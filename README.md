# PSO-SSGA

This is a Java application for illustating the way in which a AI genetic algorithm and nature inspired algorithms works.
I chose the Steady State variant of GA (SSGA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).
The problem is very simple.Given a **1D** or **2D** array we have to find the minimum value,using both of the  algorithms mentioned above.
Also I added another subproblem:to find the min value of this function F : R^n -> R, F((x1,x2,...,xn) = x1^2 + x2^2 + ... + xn^2
